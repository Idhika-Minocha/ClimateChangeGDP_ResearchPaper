**Impact of Climate Change on Global Economic Scenario**

**Overview:**
This research examines how climate change affects the economic stability of both developed and developing nations, with a specific focus on temperature, rainfall, and GDP metrics over a decade (2011-2020). Using statistical methods, the study evaluates the economic disparities that climate impacts cause between these regions, highlighting the policy response of the Government of India through the National Action Plan for Climate Change.

**Key Objectives:**
- Economic Impact Assessment: Analyze the relationship between climate variables and GDP across selected developed and developing countries.
- Policy Response Analysis: Evaluate India’s climate policies and their role in mitigating economic risks associated with climate change.

**Methodology:**
- Data Collection: Used secondary data from reliable sources for climate and economic indicators for 10 countries (5 developed and 5 developing).
- Statistical Tools: Conducted hypothesis testing using P-value analysis to understand the significance of climate variables on GDP.
- Visual Analysis: Generated charts and scatter plots to depict trends in GDP, rainfall, and temperature across regions.

**Findings:**
- Significant Temperature Impact: Temperature has a marked impact on GDP in developed countries, while rainfall shows a limited effect across both country groups.
- India’s Policy Measures: India has implemented ambitious initiatives like the National Solar Mission and Green India Mission, though more rigorous action is necessary to meet climate targets.

**Conclusion:**
- The findings underscore climate change as a critical economic risk, with varying impacts across developed and developing economies. The study recommends stronger policy actions and international collaboration to curb these effects.
